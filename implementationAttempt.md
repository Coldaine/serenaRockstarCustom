# Implementation Attempt: Serena Instance Manager

This document details the sequence of actions taken in an attempt to implement the "Instance Manager" pattern for providing workspace isolation to the Serena MCP server. The attempt was ultimately unsuccessful due to persistent environment issues when launching subprocesses, and all changes were reverted.

## 1. Objective

The goal was to implement the plan outlined in `instance_manager_plan.md`. This involved creating a lightweight manager service that would launch a new, dedicated `serena-mcp-server` process for each client, rather than using a complex proxy.

## 2. Implementation Chronology

The following is a step-by-step log of the actions taken, the commands used, and the results.

### Step 1: Initial Setup and Planning

1.  **Analysis:** The initial research concluded that the base Serena architecture does not support multiple clients and that an isolation mechanism is necessary.
2.  **Planning:** A detailed plan was formulated to create an "Instance Manager". This plan was documented in `instance_manager_plan.md`.

### Step 2: Server-Side Code Modifications

1.  **Modify `mcp.py`:** The file `src/serena/mcp.py` was modified to add a `--port-file` command-line argument. This allows a newly launched server to report which port it is listening on by writing it to a file.
2.  **Create `instance_manager.py`:** The main script for the new service, `scripts/instance_manager.py`, was created. This script contained a simple Flask application with two endpoints: `/request-session` and `/release-session`.
3.  **Create Test Runner:** After encountering issues with running background processes, a helper script `scripts/run_integration_tests.py` was created to automate the process of starting the manager, running tests, and cleaning up.

### Step 3: Testing and Iterative Debugging

This phase was marked by a series of failures, primarily related to the Python environment.

1.  **Initial Test Failure (Dependencies):** The first attempts to run the tests failed because essential Python packages (`flask`, `psutil`, `pytest`, `requests`) were not installed in the environment.
    *   **Action:** Installed the missing packages using `py -m pip install ...`.

2.  **Core Test Failure (Subprocess Environment):** After installing dependencies, the tests consistently failed with an HTTP 500 error. The logs from the `instance_manager` revealed the root cause:
    ```
    [WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified
    ```
    This occurred because the `subprocess.Popen` call could not find the `serena-mcp-server` executable in the system's PATH.

3.  **Attempted Fix #1: Run as Module:**
    *   **Action:** Modified `instance_manager.py` to launch the server via `py -m serena.mcp` instead of calling the script directly.
    *   **Result:** The test failed again. The new error was:
      ```
      ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'serena'
      ```
    This indicated that the Python interpreter in the new subprocess did not know where to find the project's source code.

4.  **Attempted Fix #2: Editable Install:**
    *   **Action:** Installed the project in editable mode using `py -m pip install -e .`. This is the standard Python practice for making a project's packages available to the interpreter.
    *   **Result:** Failure. The `ModuleNotFoundError` persisted, suggesting the editable install was not being picked up by the subprocess environment.

5.  **Attempted Fix #3: Modify `PYTHONPATH`:**
    *   **Action:** Modified `instance_manager.py` to explicitly set the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable for the subprocess, pointing it to the project's `src` directory.
    *   **Result:** Failure. The `ModuleNotFoundError` persisted.

6.  **Attempted Fix #4: Change Working Directory:**
    *   **Action:** Modified `instance_manager.py` to set the `cwd` (current working directory) of the subprocess to the project's root directory.
    *   **Result:** Failure. The `ModuleNotFoundError` persisted.

7.  **Attempted Fix #5: Combine `cwd` and `PYTHONPATH`:**
    *   **Action:** Modified `instance_manager.py` to set both the `cwd` and the `PYTHONPATH`.
    *   **Result:** Failure. The `ModuleNotFoundError` persisted.

## 3. Root Cause of Failure

The repeated and intractable `ModuleNotFoundError` points to a fundamental issue with how the Python environment is configured on the system or how `subprocess.Popen` inherits (or fails to inherit) its parent's environment. Despite using standard methods that should resolve this issue (editable install, `PYTHONPATH`, `cwd`), the child process remained unable to locate the `serena` module.

This suggests a complex environment-specific problem that is not solvable by simple code changes.

## 4. Conclusion and Reversion

After multiple failed attempts to resolve the subprocess environment issue, the decision was made to halt the implementation. The approach is considered blocked until the underlying environment problem can be diagnosed and resolved by a human developer.

All created files were deleted and all modifications were reverted to return the project to its original state.

*   **Reverted:** `src/serena/mcp.py`
*   **Deleted:** `instance_manager_plan.md`
*   **Deleted:** `scripts/instance_manager.py`
*   **Deleted:** `scripts/run_integration_tests.py`
*   **Deleted:** `tests/test_manager_integration.py`
